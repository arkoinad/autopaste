# Autopaste.el

The package is to automatically paste contents from the clipboard in Macos.

## Enhancements to be made
- Support clipboard paste on Linux.
- Support rich text paste

## Warning
The current approach uses polling to paste from the clipboard. It might not be the most performant, use with caution.
